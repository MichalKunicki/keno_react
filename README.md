Hi there! 

This is my attempt on the Keno App project.

I managed to complete most of the tasks, however I wasn't able to handle the grid background color change of selected numbers after pressing "Lucky Pick". You can see my initial idea in the code. I displayed the lucky numbers as a message instead of fields on the grid.

You can select and de-select numbers manually.

I decided not to use TypeScript as I am not very experienced with it and I wanted to avoid additional errors - I wanted to finish the project in 4 hours so I opted for comfort.

As state management I used React's useContext. Also wanted to keep it as simple as possible.

Surely, the app could use some more improvements and could be perfected with a bit more time :) Hopefully we can connect and talk a bit more about the ideas I implemented and your suggestions/feedback.

I want to say that it was a fun project and I really enjoyed working on it! It was a fantastic challenge. I really hope it will be enough to get to the next stage of recrutation - betting/gambling ideas are very close to my heart (I was a poker pro for 4 years).

I am looking forward to the next steps of the recrutation process. :)

Have a good day!
